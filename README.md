Prelab: level-0 block diagram and the state diagram

Problem:
1.	Design a RAM which can read and write 8-bit width data in 8 different memory locations. Write a Verilog code and testbench for your above design.
2.	Design an ROM which can store 4-bit width data in 8 different memory locations. Write a Verilog code and testbench for your above design. Write a Verilog code and testbench for your above design.
3.	Design a Sequential multiplier which can multiply 2 numbers where the input data width is 4 bits. Write a Verilog code and testbench for your above design.
4.	Draw the level -0 block diagram for each of the designs. 
5.	Show your demonstration to lab TA.
6.	Write a report following the Lab report writing format. Create an account in Github and upload your code with a proper ReadMe file and share the link.
